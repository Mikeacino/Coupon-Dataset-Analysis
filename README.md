# Coupon-Dataset-Analysis
This is a project for my Machine Learning/AI Certification Course. The project is semi-guided in analyzing a dataset concerning coupon acceptance.

The project starts with a guided analysis of the coupons regarding the Bar coupons. This starts with removing some blank rows, and using visualizations to do some preliminary analysis. Here I found that there was a difference in acceptance rate depending on the type of coupon. Another analysis showed that while ther was a disparity between the sample size of different temperature, there was no significant disparity between their acceptance rate.

The next section begins the analysis of specifically the bar coupons. Further analysis showed that drivers who reporting visiting a bar more than three times a month were significantly more likely to accept a bar coupon. Following this, I subset the data using different metrics. These metrics showed a consistent increase in acceptance for those who visit bars more often, but showed no great differences when factoring in age or being divorced.

Finally, I performed analysis on the Coffe House coupons. In this analysis I found that drivers who reported visiting a coffee house more oftne had a higher acceptance rate, with small differences depending on the weather.

Looking at the larger dataset, it seems like coupons directed at users who frequently visit places similar to the coupon's location are more likely to be accepted.
